# Data
### Data collection

Implementing policies emphasizing alternatives to arrest and criminalization can help to reduce the number of arrests for non-violent offenses. The collection and analysis of relevant data are essential in creating effective policies. They can guide decision-making, monitor the effects of interventions, and quantify them when applied successfully. 
A variety of circumstances can influence an arrest. Types of non-violent offenses, areas where these offenses occur frequently, how many occurrences for each non-violent offense and the identity of those involved are just a few among many examples.

1. Identify the types of non-violent crimes that are most frequent, resulting in arrests in a particular area, and at what time they occur more often. Low-level theft, drug possession, and minor traffic violation, to name a few, which could be done by examining arrest records and identifying trends in the crimes being prosecuted.
   
2. Collect information on the demographics of those detained for non-violent offenses. This data might contain information on ethnicity, gender, age, and socio-economic status, which can assist in identifying inequalities in the criminal justice system. 
   
3. Collect information on police practices and procedures, such as arrests rate, how many police officers were involved, or whether brute force was employed, is essential to understand the extent to which the arrests are being made for non-violent infractions without the use of violence.
   
4. Collect information on alternative social programs available that can help lessen the need for arrests, such as community-based mental health, rehab addiction treatment, and community-service programs.
   
5. Collect information about the period that these non-violent offenses occur more frequently.
   
### Measurements

Using data from every local authority, from municipally to district to county to state, is an excellent measuring indication. Then, summarize in these following elements: types of offenses, frequency, demographic and economic impact.

Map all local jurisdictions in accordance with the types and numbers of crimes, the local population, demographics, and the presence or absence of a significant number of disadvantaged and unprivileged groups. Examine the socioeconomic condition of the criminals and whether they were local or not when the crimes were committed. How many police officers work in each local jurisdiction?

In each local jurisdiction, compare the overall number of crimes and the proportion of each offense by age, gender, and ethnicity over time. Also, check to see what percentage of crimes are re-offended. The better use of all available resources is reflected in a drop in the incidence of violations overall.
