# How to interpret the analysis

In order for policymakers, law enforcement, and community members to develop potential solutions for preventing or reducing non-violent crimes and improving public safety in their communities, first, it is crucial to examine the data for inconsistency, checking for errors and gaps for potential misleading information. Second, careful attention to details of what the number might reveal.

Start by searching for patterns and trends in the data, such as the areas with higher or higher crime rates, which ones are most common, and at what time their occurrence. This help targets specific types of crime for prevention and intervention measures. In addition, the socioeconomic class, race, age, and gender of the offenders, as well as who is most at risk for committing these crimes.
This will identify the potential reasons why non-violent crimes occur and what steps might be taken to address the root of the problems better.

Compare and contrast the data across different variables to uncover potential relationships. For example, there may be a link between unemployment and drug addiction, or between drug usage and a given time in a day, or perhaps between age or gender and neighborhood regions, indicating gang group activity.

Based on the analysis, draw conclusions about the nature and extension of non-violent crime in the impacted community, developing policies that address the problems.
Strategies that deliver the appropriate resources, such as increasing patrolling in high-risk areas, or expanding access to education or drug rehabilitation programs, improving the well-being of the offender and the community entirely.
