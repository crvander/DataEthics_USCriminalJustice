# Increased Justice

### Identifying the need for new laws

Using the analysis in a proper context will assist in evaluating and identifying gaps or flaws in current laws that might have been contributing to non-violent crimes and are no longer adequate to cover them, allowing policymakers and community members to implement new policies or amend the existing ones to be more effective to their needs, eliminating the gaps, and maximizing the positive impact on society.

### Ensuring fairness and equity

Developing new laws or amending the existing ones in a fair and just way, based on data, will ensure that all individuals, especially those vulnerable and marginalized ones, will have the same resources and opportunities. Also, better allocation of resources, such as socio-economic or social programs, will prevent or decrease non-violent crime rates.
