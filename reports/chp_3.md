# Ethnical concerns

### Privacy and confidentiality

If the data is sensitive or individually identifiable, such as criminal background, mental health, or substance use, it raises questions regarding privacy and confidentiality. Individuals must consent before any personal information is collected or used, and there must be a way for them to withdraw at any time. In addition, they must be informed on how the data will be collected,  kept confidential, and only utilized under the new policy.

#### Response

Organizations must ensure that data is collected in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, limiting the collection and use of data to only what is necessary for the stated purpose. This means that individuals should be fully informed about how their data will be collected and used, the types of data collected, who will have access to it, and what steps will be taken to safeguard their privacy. This will build trust and reassure individuals that their data is being handled responsibly.

Additionally, adopt and implement appropriate data security measures to protect the data collected, such as encryption, access controls, and secure storage â€“password-protected databases. This will help protect individuals' personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure and minimize the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

### Discrimination
Some groups may be disproportionately affected, especially those who traditionally faced discrimination in the criminal justice system, such as the Black and Latinx communities or those less advantaged economically. As a result, they may be perceived as a threat to society or as less trustworthy, leading to discrimination, inequality, and social exclusion.

#### Response

Ensure diversity in data collection. It is essential to ensure that data collection teams are diverse and representative of the studied populations. This helps avoid biases and ensures that data collection reflects the experiences of all individuals. Additionally, it should include information on all relevant factors that may impact arrest rates, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, socio-economic status, and location to identify patterns of discrimination and to develop policies to address them.
