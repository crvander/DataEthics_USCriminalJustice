# Contexts of use for the analysis

After the data is collected and analyzed with all steps observed previously, there are two ways to use it. The appropriate one is ensuring it is ethical, effective, and just. This includes protecting individuals' privacy and civil rights, avoiding discrimination and bias, ensuring data accuracy and security, and being transparent about its methods and use. The inappropriate is the one that perpetuates discrimination, intolerance, or injustice, unfairly target specific people or populations, or violates individuals' rights and freedoms. The first one is what we should concentrate our attention on.

### Appropriate

If properly used, this analysis can be a powerful tool to provide insights and identify patterns, trends, and connections between non-violent criminal activities and areas where they occur. As a result, it can assist legislators, and law enforcement in allocating resources more efficiently in problematic areas through social-economic policies, law enforcement, or both, raising public safety. 

Additionally, the report can help to estimate the chance that those who have already been detained will engage in criminal activities again, considering options for rehabilitation programs, for instance, either they re-offend, or there are chances they will.

#### Inappropriate

The information should not be used in any hypothesis to target, discriminate against, or harm particular individuals or groups, especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized, based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or socio-economic status, as this could violate civil rights and perpetuate systemic biases that would disproportionately affect vulnerable communities.

Likewise, it cannot, under any circumstances, penalize repeat offenders unfairly for non-violent offenses, regardless of the reason. Finally, this data should not be shared across other programs. If the individuals withdraw, the data should be immediately erased, along with any information that may be recovered or that can possibly identify them in the future.
