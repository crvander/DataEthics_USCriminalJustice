### Data Ethics in American Criminal Justice
The American criminal justice system is a web of tangled, complicated, and non-isolated problems that burden taxpayers to a government institution, creating a compelling need for policy reform.  

My analysis sheds light on one particular solution, out of many, that can potentially improve our justice system. American Criminal Justice is a giant puzzle. Like many other puzzles, it is possible to start anywhere –pick a piece randomly. Still, it can take longer, and we might lose track and motivation to solve it.
Due to its complexity, no single solution will solve all American Criminal Justice puzzles. However, several adjustments might be implemented to improve the Criminal system overall.
